<!-- Hello! I am an AI Research Scientist at POSTECH under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/postechdi/member/faculty">Hwanjo Yu</a>.  -->

My goal is to bring about newness in the world through AI. 

Concretely, I aim to help people make their daily decisions through practical <b>Recommender Systems</b>.

My research interests include <b> Knowledge Distillation, Continual Learning, and Generative Models such as LLM and Diffusion Models. </b>

I'm open to collaboration, so please feel free to contact me <u>(kbin6961@gmail.com)</u>.

For your reference, I attached my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV(Gyuseok_Lee).pdf">CV</a>.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
