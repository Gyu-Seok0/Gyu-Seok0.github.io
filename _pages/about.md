<!-- Hello! I am an AI Research Scientist at POSTECH under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/postechdi/member/faculty">Hwanjo Yu</a>.  -->


I earned my M.S. degree in Artifical Intelligence at POSTECH under the guidance of <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/postechdi/home'> Prof. Hwanjo Yu </a>.

I completed my B.S. degree with a dual major in Computer Science and Mathematics/Statistics, graduating magna cum laude from Handong Global University.

My research interests lie in Information Retreiveal, Recommender Systems, Continual Learning, Knowledge Distillation, and Generative Methods (e.g., LLMs and Diffusion Models).

For your reference, I attached my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
